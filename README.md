# Minishell 
This program is about creating a simple shell. It interacts with the user through a terminal and with that replicates the behaviour of bash terminal. <br>
The goal of this program is, to learn a lot about processes and file descriptors. <br> <br>

## How to rum
* In your terminal run: ```make```
* Then type in ```./minishell``` and get creative on your shell commands ;-)
* You can **exit** the program by typing in ```exit```
